# Fair-KMeans

**Designed and implemented an algorithm to enforce demographic fairness in k-means clustering by:**

- Integrating external fairness distributions for protected attributes using OpenAI API
- Computing per-cluster fairness deviations and adjusting assignments iteratively
- Preserving clustering performance via silhouette score thresholds
- Applicable to fairness-critical domains like hiring and policy analytics
